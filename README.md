# RobotCode
Arduino code for the Quadrupede robot

## Features

The code runs on an Arduino DUE board and allows to power a quadrupede robot. The library contains a parameterized set of moves, which can be assembled into sequences to perform complex manoeuvers. It is also possible to tune the parameters in real time, to control the robot remotely. Continuous interpolation is performed between moves when a parameter is changed, so that the robot movement remains always smooth.

## Preview from RobotSim

Code for the simulator is available in this [parent repository](https://github.com/ericleib/RobotSim) (requires the Processing tool)
